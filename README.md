# VisualDinoGame
A version of the classic dino-game, but instead of jumping being controlled on the keyboard, it is controlled by waving a marker around. 
Mostly made for me to practice image processing using opencv.
## Dependencies
To play the game, you will need to install the following packages:
- numpy (`pip3 install numpy`)
- pygame (`pip3 install pygame`)
- openCV (`pip3 install opencv-python`)
You will also need a green highlighter that will be your controller, a webcam and a properly lit room.
## To be done
Improvements I would like to make to this projekt would be (in order of importance):
- Scoring needs to be implemented fully
- Both obstacles and the dino should be textured
- Some kind of GUI to start and restart the game should be made
- Saving highscores with initials
- Configuration and calibration should be implemented to make playing in different environments easier
